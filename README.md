# Spacegrey Blackboard Syntax Theme for Atom

I've officially moved to Atom and ported over a modified blackboard theme from Sublime. The difference this time is I've tweaked most of the colors to be more "modern" adding in greys and desaturating some of the stronger colors. I've kept the contrast high so it's easy to recognize code structure.
